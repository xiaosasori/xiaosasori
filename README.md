### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Minh Anh.
I'm a fullstack developer who loves working with Vue and Javascript.

When I'm not working, I like to create and improve personal side projects to practice newly-acquired skills. I'm still working on solidifying my understanding of Nuxt, and plan to follow that up with learning Go and building full-stack applications. 

ðŸ¤”: Node.js as backend development is sweet but seems hard to find a company use it.
